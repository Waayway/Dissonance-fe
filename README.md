# Dissonance
Dissonance is a Discord Clone i am currently working on. The main purpose for this is to teach myself frontend and backend dev and experiment with some frameworks.

Currently i dislike working on the frontend the most. So I am starting out with that.

I'm currently still in High school (Netherlands dont know how that relates to American and stuff) In the Class Informatica we are going to be talking about Databases, so i will wait for that to complete the backend.
